# PythonNotes
Python Notes for AI

## Requirements

Get Anaconda from https://www.anaconda.com/download/

Prof. van Niekerk prefers Python 3.6 and I (Craig) prefer 2.7. 

Either way, you likely want the 64-bit version.

Grab the version you prefer, install it, and open up the rest of the notes using Jupyter Notebooks.

If you want to generate pdf files from your notebooks you'll want to grab Pandoc.

Get it from http://pandoc.org/installing.html#macos
